 ## Project Title
 The 3-Coloured Distributive Consensus Problem
 ## Brief Description
 Using cellular automata, the problem of distributed consensus with cells of two different colours has been well studied. Certain kinds of rules (e.g. the GKL rule ) will lead to a eventual "global consensus". However, the system changes its behaviour when cells of a colour reaches to a certain fraction , p. This can be thought of as a "phase transition". In this project, we will study the same problem, but with cells of 3 different colours. We aim to find a rule which exhibits similar "phase transition" properties in this 3-coloured case, and explore its implications in statistical mechanics, as well as other areas in Physics.
